# Urban-Pollution-Analytics-and-Forecasting-System-using-Graph-Neural-Networks-GNNs-
Overview

The Urban Pollution Analytics and Forecasting System is an AI-driven project designed to analyze, model, and forecast pollution levels in urban environments. Using advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Label Propagation, and PageRank algorithms, the system captures complex spatial and temporal relationships between different pollution nodes, such as industrial areas, traffic zones, and residential regions.

 Key Features

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Model interconnected pollution sources and their influence on air quality.

Label Propagation Algorithm: Enhance data consistency by spreading known pollution labels across related nodes.

PageRank Analysis: Identify key pollution-contributing zones with the highest environmental impact.

Forecasting Engine: Predict future air quality trends based on historical data and network patterns.

Data Visualization: Provide interpretable pollution maps and trend graphs for better decision-making.

 Objective

To build a smart, data-driven framework that supports city planners, environmental researchers, and policymakers in monitoring pollution dynamics, improving urban air quality, and achieving sustainable city goals.

 Relevance to SDG

This project aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities, focusing on cleaner, resilient, and more sustainable urban environments.

 Technologies Used

Machine Learning / Deep Learning: Graph Neural Networks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)

Algorithms: Label Propagation, PageRank

Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, NetworkX

Visualization: Power BI 

Languages: Python

 Outcome

The system delivers actionable insights to identify critical pollution zones, predict future air quality trends, and assist in environmental policy formation through intelligent graph-based analytics.
